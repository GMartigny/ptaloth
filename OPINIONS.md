##Some criticism (those are my opinions and in no way facts

Some ideogram are composed of others :

* "ki" (me) + nga (awake) => kinga (fix) ?
* "ki" (me) + ka (you) => kika (process) ?
* "aa" (light) + d (age) => "aad" (vegetable)
* ...


Some ideogram should be a combination of two (so they shouldn't be in the alphabet)

* "devit" (left arm) should be "de" (left) "vit" (arm) for example
* "thoeda" (land animal) should be "tho" (animal) "eda" (land) for example
* "wogao" (tree) should be "wo" (big) "gao" (plant) for example [This one works, but "wogao" shouldn't be in the alphabet]
* ...


Some ideogram are a draw with two but for no reason
* "amyade" (year) is written "mya" (jour) + "dye" (night)
* "nea" (beyond) is written "olla" (and) + "ksan" (dead)
* "keka" (creature) is written "voi" (fact) + "sota" (apart) 
* ...


Some ideograms look alike but don't mean the same at all :
* "mu" (object) and "misk" (art)
* "hua" (alone) and "mya" (day)
* ...


"amar" (family) is composed of "koga" (mother) + "kago" (father) + "kige" (sibling)
That's not the only way to have a family.

Their's no plural or tenses ?
But their's "yo" (am) and "nel" (is) ?

Maybe, have a look at [Bliss language](http://www.blissymbolics.org/images/bliss-rules.pdf)
